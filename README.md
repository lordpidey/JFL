# JFL - Java Flist Library

## Overview

JFL is a Java library for the sexual roleplaying website f-list.net, offering features for easy implementation of clients and bots for F-chat, and general access of API endpoint data.

##Code Example

The following code is a simple implementation of the FClient class which reads a JSON file containing the userâ€™s login information, logs into F-chat, and joins a specified private channel.

```java
package jfl;
import org.json.JSONObject;

public class Bot extends FClient {
    public Superbot(String clientName,String clientVersion) throws Exception {
        super(clientName,clientVersion);
    }

    @Override public void onLogin() throws Exception {
        joinChannel("ADH-491cbcdbbbe8039e87cb");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        JSONObject loginInfo=FUtil.loadJSON("data/LoginInfo.json");  
        Bot myBot=new Bot(loginInfo.getString("client name"),
                               loginInfo.getString("client version"));
        myBot.login(loginInfo.getString("username"),
                    loginInfo.getString("character"),
                    loginInfo.getString("password"));
    }
}
```
